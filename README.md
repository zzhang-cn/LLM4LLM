# LLM4LLM: A Progressive Learning Series

This repository contains materials for a flipped classroom discussion series on Large Language Models (LLMs), designed for non-CS/AI students, researchers, and professors. The goal is to build a fundamental understanding of LLMs through guided exploration and structured discussions.

## Why LLM4LLM?

Large Language Models have evolved at a breathtaking pace, making it challenging for educators and learners to keep up. This project offers a direct path to understanding these complex systems without getting lost in technical minutiae.

The content is structured in three tiers:
- **Core Concepts**: Explained through analogies and visualizations for everyone
- **Hands-On Implementation**: Practical code examples for CS students
- **Advanced Theory**: Mathematical foundations for those interested in deeper understanding

Learners can engage with whichever tier matches their background and interests, diving deeper in areas they find most relevant.

## The Science Behind the Series

This curriculum is structured around three fundamental principles that parallel both machine learning development and human cognition:

1. **Information as Distributed Representation**: Knowledge exists not as discrete facts but as distributed patterns across neural networks. Module 1 explores how information is encoded in these representations.

2. **Attention and Pattern Retrieval**: Learning involves developing mechanisms to identify relevant patterns within vast inputs. Module 2 examines how models sift through potentially very long inputs to find the relevant "keys" to retrieve stored patterns.

3. **Goal-Directed Learning**: Beyond simple imitation, true learning is driven by rewards oriented toward specific goals. Module 3 investigates how reinforcement mechanisms guide models toward aligned behaviors.

These principles not only explain how modern LLMs function but also reflect fundamental aspects of human cognition, creating a bridge between artificial and natural intelligence.

## The Meta-Experiment: LLMs Explaining Themselves

This curriculum represents a recursive experiment: using LLMs to explain their own inner workings. As these models become more capable, the teaching materials can potentially improve in tandem - from creating more effective visualizations to incorporating new research insights about LLM mechanisms.

This creates a self-reflexive learning system that may evolve alongside the technology it teaches. See [self-evolve.md](./self-evolve.md) for our experimental prompt that guides LLMs in analyzing and enhancing these materials.

## Recommended Learning Approach

### Learning Paths

You can follow either of these learning paths:

1. **Standard Sequential Approach**:
   - Progress through **modules** in sequential order (Module 1 → Module 2 → Module 3)
   - Within each module, complete **sessions** in numerical order (Session 1.1 → Session 1.2 → etc.)

2. **Philosophical Bookend Approach** (Recommended):
   - Begin with [Session 3.4: Philosophical Perspectives on AI Understanding](./module-3/s3.4-prompt.md) (First Pass only)
   - Then progress through the technical curriculum in order (Module 1 → Module 2 → Module 3, Sessions 3.1-3.3)
   - Finally, return to Session 3.4 for the Second Pass reflection
   - This approach allows you to compare your before-and-after perspectives on fundamental AI questions

Choose the approach that best suits your learning style. The philosophical bookend approach provides a powerful frame of reference by capturing your initial intuitions and then revealing how technical knowledge transforms your understanding.

### Session Management

Each learning session is designed as a single learning unit that you can work through at your own pace. One of the advantages of learning with generative AI is the ability to save your progress and return to continue exactly where you left off.

#### Starting a New Session
1. Begin with the pre-prompt to establish the learning framework
2. Load the appropriate session prompt (e.g., module-1/s1.1-prompt.md)
3. Engage with the content through interactive dialogue

#### Continuing a Session
If you need to pause and resume a session:
1. Return to your previous conversation where you were working on the session
2. You can simply continue where you left off
3. If needed, you can navigate to specific Knowledge Points (KPs)
   - Example: "I'd like to continue with Knowledge Point 3"
   - Or: "Let's review Knowledge Point 2 before moving on"

#### Navigating Between Knowledge Points
Within a session, you can freely navigate between Knowledge Points (KPs):
- Ask "What Knowledge Points are in this session?" to get an overview
- Say "Go to Knowledge Point X" to jump to a specific KP
- Say "Review Knowledge Point X" to revisit a previously completed KP
- Ask "What's my current progress?" to see which KPs you've completed
- Request a summary of previously covered concepts
- Ask clarifying questions about material from earlier in the session

#### Completing a Session
When you finish a session:
1. Load the post-prompt for evaluation
2. Review your learning assessment before moving to the next session
3. Begin the next session in a new conversation

This approach offers several benefits:
- Creates a searchable archive of your learning journey
- Makes it easy to continue where you left off
- Allows focused exploration of specific concepts
- Ensures each session can be completed at your own pace

### Session Structure

Each session follows a consistent three-part structure:

1. **Pre-prompt Phase** ([pre-prompt.md](./pre-prompt.md))
   - Sets the learning framework for self-directed exploration
   - Defines student responsibilities and evaluation criteria
   - Establishes knowledge scaffolding approach
   - **Must be loaded first** before beginning any session

2. **Session Prompt Phase** (e.g., `module-1/s1.1-prompt.md`)
   - Contains the primary question and learning activities for the session
   - Provides step-by-step exploration paths
   - Includes hands-on exercises, discussion prompts, and checkpoints
   - Builds on concepts from previous sessions

3. **Post-prompt Phase** ([post-prompt.md](./post-prompt.md))
   - Evaluates learning progress across five dimensions
   - Identifies strengths and areas for improvement
   - Provides scores and specific examples from the conversation
   - Suggests next steps for continued learning

### Navigating Content Tiers

Use these commands to navigate between content tiers:
- Say "core concepts" to focus on fundamental ideas accessible to everyone
- Say "implementation" to explore hands-on code examples (for CS students)
- Say "theory" to dive into mathematical foundations and advanced concepts
- Say "all tiers" to see content from all three tiers for the current knowledge point

## Three-Tier Learning Structure

This curriculum accommodates learners with different backgrounds through three tiers of content:

### Core Concepts (For Everyone)
- Accessible explanations using analogies and visualizations
- No programming or mathematical background required
- Focus on intuitive understanding of fundamental principles
- Suitable for all learners regardless of technical background

### Hands-On Implementation (For CS Students)
- Practical code examples using PyTorch
- Implementation details and programming exercises
- Requires basic programming knowledge
- Best for those with computer science background

### Advanced Theory (For the Curious)
- Mathematical foundations and theoretical details
- Connections to broader information theory and research
- Formal definitions and derivations
- Appropriate for those interested in deeper theoretical understanding

You can freely navigate between these tiers based on your interests and background. All learners should engage with the Core Concepts tier, while the other tiers are optional based on your background and learning goals.
